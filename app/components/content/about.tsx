          Hi, I'm a software engineer with 5 years of experience. I've worked on web applications using various 
          frameworks such as React.js and AngularJS. Additionally, I've developed desktop applications focused on the 
          backend using .NET.

          I'm passionate about continuous learning to improve my skills and take on new challenges. 
          I enjoy solving problems with technology and collaborating across teams.

          Over the past 5 years, I've contributed to both frontend and backend solutions. I've implemented scalable and 
          maintainable systems using clean architecture and DevOps practices to ensure reliable code deployment.
